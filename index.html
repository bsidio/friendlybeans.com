            <h2>About the Event</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Friendly Beans - Sunday Side Project Coworking Sessions!</p>
            <p>Please RSVP by accepting the invite if you're planning on coming - this will help us manage how much food to get + other logistics!</p>
            <h3>What's this?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A super warm group of folks keeping each other accountable, working in sessions/pomodoros of 50 minutes of work and 10 mins of break time (it works, trust)</li>
                <li>The project you work on can be anything! Ex. coding an app, knitting, making beats, painting shoes - as long as its something you want to do and not your main "thing" (that means no school work if you're a student, no job work if you're employed)</li>
                <li>At the end, we'll have 2 minute demos for people to talk about what they worked on — it's opt in so no pressure!</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>We've been procrastinating too much on our side projects even though we have so much fun doing them - feels like we're not alone in this and want to keep others accountable for working on what they're passionate about</li>
                <li>We've met a ton of really fun friends by making things we care about—and want to find other caring tinkerers!</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="rules">
            <h2>Rules/guidelines on how to act</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>DON'T work on your main thing (school or your job) - if you don't know what to work on, I'm sure we can help you find something</li>
                <li>Act like a host, include people in conversations, talk to people even if they're strangers, offer to help out and clean up, don't network if you're here to network we will be so sad, come to make stuff and find super fun friends :)</li>
                <li>Bring snacks if you're feeling kind!</li>
            </ul>
